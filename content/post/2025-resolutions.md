# Q1 Goals

Some goals specific to my vacation this March, but also probably good to keep up
for the rest of the year.

1. Lose weight (~5kg) - going to a wedding
2. Brush up on Chinese - going to HK
   - Not really required to get around, but one time I tried ordering bubble tea
     and couldn't even say what I wanted
3. Try to eat out less
   - Lines up with Goal 1 and 2, since I'm going on a trip and need to save up

# The rest of the year

The most generic resolutions you'll find.

1. Record myself talking every day
   - I want to be able to tolerate my voice
   - Also to improve my speaking because I get lazy pronouncing stuff
2. Reduce (useless) screen time
   - Keep my phone on greyscale
3. Consume less, create more
   - This has been my goal for a while, but perfectionism always gets in the way
   - Try to write and publish every day (charles.thyck.top)
   - Time for music covers?
4. Keep track of my money
   - Before I just put whatever is left from credit card bills into my savings,
     but now I want to actually try to hit a savings percentage as a goal
   - 60% is probably attainable considering my living situation

EDIT:

More goals after a conversation with Jherzey:

1. Move out
2. Greet people on their birthdays
   - First step is finding out what their birthdays are
     - I only know mine because I have to use it to fill out forms (I still
       forget sometimes)
     - I only know one (1) of my sisters' birthdays because it's the same as mine
     - I only know Jherzey's because she'll get mad otherwise
