I got my passport today so I am now legally allowed to leave the country 😌

I think I should start scheduling my off-work hours because I'm bad at time
management and get distracted easily. It's already past midnight that I'm
writing on the journal.

EDIT:

I forgot to add why I wanted to do this in the first place. I found an old
notebook of mine from 5+ years ago that had this entry:

Funny how stuff just works itself out. Finding this made me wish I wrote more,
so I put it as a New Year's Resolution.
