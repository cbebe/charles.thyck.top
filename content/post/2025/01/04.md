Slept pretty much until the afternoon and then worked on
[CitySync](https://citysync.ca) stuff.

It's already Sunday so I basically skipped 2 days of journalling. I definitely
need to streamline this process. I could try using Obsidian for easier
journalling and then automate the publishing processs.
