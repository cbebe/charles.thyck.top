Went straight to University after meeting my friend David to tour the Gen Z gang
around the campus.

It was pretty nice to go back to the places I used to study in pre-pandemic and
tell them about it.

Not sure if newer students starting now would be able to do stuff that I've done
before. Makes me wonder what other people did in the past that we weren't
allowed to do anymore when I started university.
