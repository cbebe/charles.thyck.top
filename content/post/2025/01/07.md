Pretty productive day!

[Found a beat for focusing at work](/post/dev-log/music) so I don't have to sit
in silence anymore.

I also tried out some online shopping haul with Jherzey after work before eating
[momos](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momo_(food)>).

Just now, I set up Anki with
[Cantonese flashcards](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/256323836). I picked one
without Chinese characters so I actually have to associate sounds to meaning.

I've also been consistently waking up at 7 which means that I can finally get to
sleep early (which is why I'm actually able to write before midnight now).

I still don't have a set schedule for learning stuff and working on side
projects so that's something I should set up by this week.
