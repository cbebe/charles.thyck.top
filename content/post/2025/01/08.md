Woke up early today and did cardio. Almost puked but the cold shower afterwards
hit different.

Also super locked in at work.

Had K-BBQ at home for dinner with pork belly and organ meats.

I asked Jherzey to help me skin the cat and it definitely scared her. I did more
after she left but my right shoulder started hurting. I'm gonna have to take it
easy on the shoulder exercises.

EDIT: Still haven't come up with a schedule. I'm going to try coming up with one
while in bed.
