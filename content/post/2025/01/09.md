This was the day that I got up at 6 but stayed in bed until 9 ðŸ˜­ so much for
waking up early.

I ate a small clove of garlic in the morning and it was pretty spicy. Tried
eating a bigger one and it gave me a crazy heartburn.

Had a CitySync discussion with Michael before he leaves for Vietnam.

I also tried out Reaper but didn't get too far. This was mostly why I didn't get
to journal for this day, but I also had to deal with a super annoying bug at
work way past work hours.

The skin the cats that I did this day and the day before made me very sore. I'm
probably not going to do any more heavy moves for a while since the pull-up bar
is starting to leave a dent in the wall.
