I actually got up at 6 and felt a lot more motivated today. The fact that I was
probably around only 70% productivity the day before meant that I had to go ham
today. I finally got around starting my daily/weekly planner (and actually
following it).

Also the fact that I also got approved for my PH vacation gave me a lot more
motivation.

Walked to Jherzey's place while it was raining and super slippery outside. I
actually slipped and landed on my butt.

My Cantonese review deck is also finally piling up. I'm probably going to have
to have a longer study session tomorrow (or try to lighten it up today).
