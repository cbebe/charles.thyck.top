Gonna have to combine these two because I forgot what I did already aside from
the times I went out ðŸ˜­.

I slept for half the day for both days and just planned our trip.

Saturday: Unlimited K-BBQ at Ginseng with Jherzey and Ate Mup. I could've eaten
a lot more but tried to hold back.

Sunday: Jerusalem Shawarma and Krispy Kreme with
[Yahya and Kyle](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yahya-al-shamali_capstoneproject-riscv-fpga-ugcPost-7185133097288437760-Zjjd).

Lots of cramming on flashcards as well, but not as much as today (Monday).
