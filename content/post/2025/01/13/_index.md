Productive day at work despite waking up at 9am.

I think I have really overdone the flashcards now.

![Running total of 554 cards to review in 6 days.](./running.webp)

I don't even have the vocabulary that actually matters, which are dim sum items.

![581 new cards to go](./counts.webp)

But I think I'm making good progress on the new cards. I could probably be
exposed to the entire deck by the end of the month. I'm just hoping I retain
them until March.
