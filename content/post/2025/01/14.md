Got up at 9am again today. No worries though, since the rest of my day wasn't
wasted.

I finally followed my scheduled tasks, limiting my Anki review to only 1 hour
today. That meant fewer new cards today, but at least I didn't waste any more
time with it and lightened up my review load to only 239 cards for tomorrow.

I also got the chance to get some physical activity:

- Walking to Jherzey's (30 mins)
- Played red light, green light with kids while tricking them to eat
  - One was saying it subbed (무궁화 꽃 이 피었 습니다), and one was dubbed (red light,
    green light) which I found funny
- A few pushups to get my elbow joints moving while water changing
- 20 minute HIIT workout

I also started transferring images from my phone to free up some storage. I'm
really running low right now, and putting it all in one 3 TB hard drive makes me
nervous. Maybe a NAS could be a birthday gift to myself for this year.
