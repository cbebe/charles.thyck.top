Been consistently waking up at 9am which is good in a way because I'm being
consistent, but bad in a way because it's so late. My alarm clocks are failing
me for some reason.

I had to slowly clear out the 239 cards to review throughout the day, and now I
have 244 cards for tomorrow. It's really going to be a grind this week but I
only have 425 new cards out of 1210.

Today wasn't cold either, so I walked to Jherzey's after work and helped clean
her room.

I was also able to back up my entire photo gallery, but haven't freed up space
on my phone and desktop yet. Maybe on the weekend.
