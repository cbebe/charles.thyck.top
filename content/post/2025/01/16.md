Finally got unblocked at a task at work. Doesn't mean I'm done though.

I went to Jherzey's by walking just like the previous days, but didn't know
there was a snows squall. That made the walk pretty interesting. I had to go
back home and actually bundle up to cover my face.

After shovelling, I spent 3 hours with Devin to solve a false LSP error on some
embedded C toolchain. We failed to actually get rid of it, but it was a
character-building experience.
