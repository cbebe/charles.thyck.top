Been sleeping too much on weekends recently. I planned on going out to downtown
on Saturday but woke up at 4:30 pm. I just did flashcards, watched some YouTube,
and went back to sleep for 12 hours again.

Today I did go out tubing and eat out with the Gen Z gang.

This weekend was mostly just watching the interactions between American and
Chinese people on 小红书 (Rednote).
