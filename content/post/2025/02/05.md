Well, that was short-lived. My last post was
[17 days ago](/post/2025/01/18-19/). Maybe the fact that I made an actual blog
post made this too high-effort. If it wasn't for Jherzey reminding me about my
website, I probably wouldn't have started again. Here we go...

The past 2 weeks was consumed by tons of distractions, with no opportunity to
get bored. I binge-watched Over Run Over on YouTube, and once that was done,
binge-watched Trauma Code on Netflix. Then I started playing Half Sword. I have
sunk into a new low when it comes to boredom by actually playing video games. I
say every day "tomorrow I'll get it together", and I don't ðŸ˜­[^1].

I do have some good news though. I've been doing flashcards so consistently,
that I've finally reviewed all cards the in base deck and have started adding
more cards. We've also started planning out new features for CitySync so I will
have to grind hard this month.

[^1]: BTW today marks 10 years since I've arrived in Canada. Maybe today will be
my last day to make excuses.
