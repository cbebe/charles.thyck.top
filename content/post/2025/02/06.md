I got too deep into refactoring and worked past 9 PM ðŸ˜­

It's Friday tomorrow anyway, so maybe I could get off early once I've done all
of the important tasks.

Today is Jherzey and Jesse's last day in Cancun so I'm going to accompany
Jherzey's dad to the airport to pick them up. Might grab some food after that.
