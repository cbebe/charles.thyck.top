I hope my ~~namesake~~[^1] pianist [Charles
Ancheta](https://anchetamusic.wordpress.com/about/) claims it back eventually.
'charlesancheta.com' used to redirect to his Facebook page before I registered
the domain as mine.

This summer, I went out of the country for almost 2 months. I promised my
girlfriend I wouldn't be doing any programming for the entire duration of the
vacation. As soon as I arrived in the Philippines, I locked up my laptop in a
drawer to make sure that I would not touch it until I have to (when school
starts).

Unfortunately, my domain 'charlesancheta.com' expired around mid-August ðŸ˜­. I
guess that's what I get for not turning on auto-renew. I didn't want to buy it
again since it started costing around $100/year.

Now I just have my personal website as a sub-domain in the only domain that I
own. It's not too bad, but now I will have to start replacing all links to my
website.

[^1]: Apparently "namesake" implies that one was named after the other. I'm
    not, so the word that I was translating was
["katokayo"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tokayo#Tagalog) or "kapangalan"
which only means "person with the same name" and never has the implication that
one was named after the other intentionally.
