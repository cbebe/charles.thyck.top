Fall 2023 was my first semester coming back after being out of school for 16
months (I tried taking CHINA 101 in Fall 2022 but dropped it after a week).

Because of that, I have forgotten how to study. Both midterms and finals went
pretty horribly. It's not even that I don't care about grades anymore, and I
definitely could have done better if I just did the practice exams thoughtfully.

Maybe it's because I only had two courses which meant that it was hard to care
about school, or that there are too many distractions now. Instagram and
[MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) are definitely the worst offenders, maybe
[抖音](https://www.douyin.com/) and [小红书](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/), too.
It surely would've been worse if I added Tiktok to the mix.

I think it's time to bring back first-year studying habits, which was having all
my notes in a clipboard and having no distracting apps. Especially with my
capstone project, it's going to be a challenging semester and I gotta lock in.
