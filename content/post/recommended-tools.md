## Git UI: [`lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)

This was a real game-changer. I don't think I can go back to using the VSCode
Git UI anymore. Lazygit has all the pros of VSCode Git UI (diff viewing, list
staged and unstaged changes) without the cons (slow pushes and pulls, is a GUI).
I have it bound to a shortcut in the shell as well, so common tasks take less
than 10 keystrokes.

## Directory jumper: [`zoxide`](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)

## Command runner: [`mprocs`](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs)
