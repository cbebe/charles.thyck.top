A couple of months ago, I help a friend set up a website for a business. Today,
I had another talk with a friend about building a portfolio website and he
asked me for a few resources. I couldn't find a comprehensive one that outlines
all the required steps so I'll try my best.

## What is a static website?

From ChatGPT:

![Question: difference between a static and dynamic website in 2 sentences -
Answer: A static website consists of fixed content that remains the same for
all users and is created using HTML/CSS, while a dynamic website uses
server-side technologies to generate content dynamically, allowing for
personalized and interactive experiences tailored to individual
users.](./static-vs-dynamic.webp)

Basically:

- Static - no server-side logic, cheaper
- Dynamic - with server-side logic, more expensive

## What makes a (static) website

Setting up a static website is basically free these days, maybe a few dollars a
year if you want a custom domain. There are many free website builders out
there. However, we're going DIY with no strings attached to any one provider.
Any of these components can be swapped with many alternatives out there if you
so choose.

You really only need two things: your **content**, which is a bunch of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript files, and a **hosting** provider, basically a computer
that serves your content 24/7.

## What we will use

I'm mostly going to outline my process because it's free (aside from the
domain) and that it's going to teach you some skills on web development.

We will need:

- A **Computer** (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- **GitHub account**  for hosting your website with GitHub Pages
- Some **programming knowledge** (very little, don't worry)
- **Patience** with my sucky writing ðŸ˜­


These would be nice to have:

- **Custom domain name** - if you don't want your domain to appear as
  `your-github-username.github.io`
- **Cloudflare account** - for email protection and easier DNS management

Since we are making a static website, most of the work will be done on your
personal computer. The hosting provider will only be concerned with serving the
final build output. For this, we would need to set up our development
environment.

Stay tuned for part 2!
