To start, we would need an application to easily edit text files, a _text
editor_. If you're new to text files, read the upcoming section for some
introduction to computer technology üòÅ

## Text Files

Text files, as opposed to binary files, do not need any special applications to
work with. If you've ever used Windows and Microsoft Office, think about the
difference between opening a Word Document (.docx) and opening a _README_ file
from some obscure application you've downloaded from the Internet. The Word
Document needs to be opened through Microsoft Word (or Google Docs if you're
broke), while the _README_ file can be opened by Notepad, WordPad, Microsoft
Word, or even your web browser. It is the most flexible file format and what
most programmers would want to work with, since they can choose whatever text
editor they want to use.

## Text Editor

While it's possible to do development with only Notepad and Command Prompt, (or
TextEdit and Terminal for Mac, or Gedit and GNOME Terminal for Ubuntu, etc.),
we would want to use a saner option, which is a text editor designed for
coding. At the time of writing, [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the most popular and the easiest to
start with. It's what I used when I started programming and what I currently
use for work, although I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for simple text
editing and personal projects.

To install Visual Studio Code, follow the instructions on the
[website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
