Being a Tagalog speaker and a language learner, I've always been interested in
etymology of Tagalog words. The obvious influences are Spanish and English, but
there's also a lot from Hokkien and Malay.

Today I'm going to list out some words that I find interesting:

- _Linggo_ (Sunday; week) - All the days in Tagalog are directly borrowed from
  Spanish one to one, except for Sunday (_domingo_). Apparently it could be from
  Malay [_minggu_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/minggu#Malay) which came from
  Portuguese [_domingo_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/domingo#Portuguese). Of
  course, both of those could be traced to Latin, and Portuguese and Spanish are
  pretty close to each other. I just find it interesting that we get to the same
  word in a pretty roundabout way.

- _dolyar_ (dollar), _gorilya_ (gorilla) - These two exhibit the same
  phenomenon, which is called a
  [pseudo-loan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary#pseudo-loan).
  We borrowed them from English, but pronounce the _ll_ like it's from Spanish.
  In Spanish, they're pronounced with a regular _l_ (dólar and gorila).

- All the bean words that have Hokkien 豆 (tāu):
  - _toyo_ - soy sauce - 豆油
  - [_taho_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taho) - soft or silken tofu snack -
    豆腐 or shortened 豆腐花 ("[_douhua_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douhua)")
  - _tokwa_ - tofu - 豆乾 ("dried tofu")
  - _tawsi_ - [_douchi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douchi) (fermented black
    beans) - 豆豉
  - _toge_ - bean sprouts - 豆芽
  - _sitaw_ - Chinese long bean - 青豆 ("green bean")
  - _bataw_ - hyacinth bean - 肉豆
