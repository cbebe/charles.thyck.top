            I got too deep into refactoring and worked past 9 PM üò≠
It&rsquo;s Friday tomorrow anyway, so maybe I could get off early once I&rsquo;ve done all of the important tasks.
Today is Jherzey and Jesse&rsquo;s last day in Cancun so I&rsquo;m going to accompany Jherzey&rsquo;s dad to the airport to pick them up. Might grab some food after that.

            Well, that was short-lived. My last post was 17 days ago. Maybe the fact that I made an actual blog post made this too high-effort. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Jherzey reminding me about my website, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have started again. Here we go&hellip;
The past 2 weeks was consumed by tons of distractions, with no opportunity to get bored. I binge-watched Over Run Over on YouTube, and once that was done, binge-watched Trauma Code on Netflix.

            As a Canadian and a non-TikTok user, I was not exactly affected by the recent US TikTok ban. I do, however, occasionally use Xiaohongshu, which I try to avoid for the same reason as I do Instagram (it&rsquo;s still social media app, after all i.e. massive time sink). This last week however, there was a huge influx of foreigners into the app which led to a lot of interesting and wholesome interactions (and a few not-so wholesome ones).

            Been sleeping too much on weekends recently. I planned on going out to downtown on Saturday but woke up at 4:30 pm. I just did flashcards, watched some YouTube, and went back to sleep for 12 hours again.
Today I did go out tubing and eat out with the Gen Z gang.
This weekend was mostly just watching the interactions between American and Chinese people on Â∞èÁ∫¢‰π¶ (Rednote).

            Drinking black coffee every day was starting to give me mouth sores. I had to use powdered creamer today.
Remember a few days ago when I said I was going to limit Anki time? I failed to stop myself again.
To be fair, probably half of flashcard time today was spent making dim sum flashcards. I actually had to do some research in Cantonese wikipedia because some of the items had weird or missing translations.

            Finally got unblocked at a task at work. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m done though.
I went to Jherzey&rsquo;s by walking just like the previous days, but didn&rsquo;t know there was a snows squall. That made the walk pretty interesting. I had to go back home and actually bundle up to cover my face.
After shovelling, I spent 3 hours with Devin to solve a false LSP error on some embedded C toolchain.

            Been consistently waking up at 9am which is good in a way because I&rsquo;m being consistent, but bad in a way because it&rsquo;s so late. My alarm clocks are failing me for some reason.
I had to slowly clear out the 239 cards to review throughout the day, and now I have 244 cards for tomorrow. It&rsquo;s really going to be a grind this week but I only have 425 new cards out of 1210.

            Got up at 9am again today. No worries though, since the rest of my day wasn&rsquo;t wasted.
I finally followed my scheduled tasks, limiting my Anki review to only 1 hour today. That meant fewer new cards today, but at least I didn&rsquo;t waste any more time with it and lightened up my review load to only 239 cards for tomorrow.
I also got the chance to get some physical activity:

            Productive day at work despite waking up at 9am.
I think I have really overdone the flashcards now.
I don&rsquo;t even have the vocabulary that actually matters, which are dim sum items.
But I think I&rsquo;m making good progress on the new cards. I could probably be exposed to the entire deck by the end of the month. I&rsquo;m just hoping I retain them until March.

            Gonna have to combine these two because I forgot what I did already aside from the times I went out üò≠.
I slept for half the day for both days and just planned our trip.
Saturday: Unlimited K-BBQ at Ginseng with Jherzey and Ate Mup. I could&rsquo;ve eaten a lot more but tried to hold back.
Sunday: Jerusalem Shawarma and Krispy Kreme with Yahya and Kyle.
Lots of cramming on flashcards as well, but not as much as today (Monday).

            Being a Tagalog speaker and a language learner, I&rsquo;ve always been interested in etymology of Tagalog words. The obvious influences are Spanish and English, but there&rsquo;s also a lot from Hokkien and Malay.
Today I&rsquo;m going to list out some words that I find interesting:
Linggo (Sunday; week) - All the days in Tagalog are directly borrowed from Spanish one to one, except for Sunday (domingo). Apparently it could be from Malay minggu which came from Portuguese domingo.

            I actually got up at 6 and felt a lot more motivated today. The fact that I was probably around only 70% productivity the day before meant that I had to go ham today. I finally got around starting my daily/weekly planner (and actually following it).
Also the fact that I also got approved for my PH vacation gave me a lot more motivation.
Walked to Jherzey&rsquo;s place while it was raining and super slippery outside.

            This was the day that I got up at 6 but stayed in bed until 9 üò≠ so much for waking up early.
I ate a small clove of garlic in the morning and it was pretty spicy. Tried eating a bigger one and it gave me a crazy heartburn.
Had a CitySync discussion with Michael before he leaves for Vietnam.
I also tried out Reaper but didn&rsquo;t get too far.

            Woke up early today and did cardio. Almost puked but the cold shower afterwards hit different.
Also super locked in at work.
Had K-BBQ at home for dinner with pork belly and organ meats.
I asked Jherzey to help me skin the cat and it definitely scared her. I did more after she left but my right shoulder started hurting. I&rsquo;m gonna have to take it easy on the shoulder exercises.

            Pretty productive day!
Found a beat for focusing at work so I don&rsquo;t have to sit in silence anymore.
I also tried out some online shopping haul with Jherzey after work before eating momos.
Just now, I set up Anki with Cantonese flashcards. I picked one without Chinese characters so I actually have to associate sounds to meaning.
I&rsquo;ve also been consistently waking up at 7 which means that I can finally get to sleep early (which is why I&rsquo;m actually able to write before midnight now).

My peers used to always ask me what I listen to while working on my computer, and they&rsquo;re always shocked to find out that I work in silence. I used to unironically listen to lofi hip hop mix üìö beats to relax/study to but I get too sleepy. When I listen to music I actually like listening to, I get too distracted.

            Fall 2023 was my first semester coming back after being out of school for 16 months (I tried taking CHINA 101 in Fall 2022 but dropped it after a week).
Because of that, I have forgotten how to study. Both midterms and finals went pretty horribly. It&rsquo;s not even that I don&rsquo;t care about grades anymore, and I definitely could have done better if I just did the practice exams thoughtfully.

            A couple of months ago, I help a friend set up a website for a business. Today, I had another talk with a friend about building a portfolio website and he asked me for a few resources. I couldn&rsquo;t find a comprehensive one that outlines all the required steps so I&rsquo;ll try my best.
What is a static website? From ChatGPT:
Basically:
Static - no server-side logic, cheaper Dynamic - with server-side logic, more expensive What makes a (static) website Setting up a static website is basically free these days, maybe a few dollars a year if you want a custom domain.

            I deleted all 4 of my NPM packages today. It has been over a year since I&rsquo;ve last updated them, and I didn&rsquo;t want to add any more clutter to the system.
I&rsquo;ve always thought that having published open source code meant something, but then I realized that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s not useful.
Learning how to package libraries and applications was a good experience, though, and I would probably publish stuff IF/WHEN I have actually solved a need.

            A new co-op position meant new hardware1, and a new technology stack to learn. Unfortunately, that includes having to use Windows. Coming back to Windows after almost 2 full years on Linux, it felt like I forgot how to use a computer. All the keyboard shortcuts that my hands were used to would do funny things like lock my laptop. I just wanted my shell, my terminal, and my tiling window manager back.

            I feel like the hardest part of writing this game would be the enemy logic. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m putting it off for as long as possible! Today I implemented map generation, randomly placing boxes sufficiently far enough from players.
I also added controls for other players, which reminded me of my local multiplayer experience with Boxhead. I miss having multiple people on play a single keyboard. These days it would be awkward to play that way.

            Feeling good today. I got to fix the collision bug that was happening yesterday. It actually had to do with the collision lifecycle, so to make the player detectable, I decoupled the check from the lifecycle of the bomb. Because of this, I could revert the player&rsquo;s bomb timer to normal. Moving away from a project and letting your brain sit on a problem for a while really does wonders.

            MAJOR BUG ALERT!!
Apparently my collision logic for the bombs weren&rsquo;t going to hold up. Every time a bomb explodes, there is a small time window where you can place a bomb and the bomb would not recognize the player, making it a &ldquo;not new&rdquo; bomb. Because of that, the player gets pushed off right away and could end up in the weirdest of places.
After hours of debugging I couldn&rsquo;t really solve it because of how the collision library orders the entity updates.
