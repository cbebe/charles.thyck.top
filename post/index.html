            <p>I got too deep into refactoring and worked past 9 PM 😭</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Friday tomorrow anyway, so maybe I could get off early once I&rsquo;ve done all
of the important tasks.</p>
<p>Today is Jherzey and Jesse&rsquo;s last day in Cancun so I&rsquo;m going to accompany
Jherzey&rsquo;s dad to the airport to pick them up. Might grab some food after that.</p>

            <p>Well, that was short-lived. My last post was
<a href="/post/2025/01/18-19/">17 days ago</a>. Maybe the fact that I made an actual blog
post made this too high-effort. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Jherzey reminding me about my
website, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have started again. Here we go&hellip;</p>
<p>The past 2 weeks was consumed by tons of distractions, with no opportunity to
get bored. I binge-watched Over Run Over on YouTube, and once that was done,
binge-watched Trauma Code on Netflix. Then I started playing Half Sword. I have
sunk into a new low when it comes to boredom by actually playing video games. I
say every day &ldquo;tomorrow I&rsquo;ll get it together&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t 😭<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>As a Canadian and a non-TikTok user, I was not exactly affected by the recent US
TikTok ban. I do, however, occasionally use Xiaohongshu, which I try to
<a href="/post/my-worst-semester-so-far/">avoid for the same reason as I do Instagram</a>
(it&rsquo;s still social media app, after all i.e. massive time sink). This last week
however, there was a huge influx of foreigners into the app which led to a lot
of interesting and wholesome interactions (and a few not-so wholesome ones).</p>

            <p>Been sleeping too much on weekends recently. I planned on going out to downtown
on Saturday but woke up at 4:30 pm. I just did flashcards, watched some YouTube,
and went back to sleep for 12 hours again.</p>
<p>Today I did go out tubing and eat out with the Gen Z gang.</p>
<p>This weekend was mostly just watching the
<a href="/post/xiaohongshu/">interactions between American and Chinese people on 小红书 (Rednote)</a>.</p>

            <p>Drinking black coffee every day was starting to give me mouth sores. I had to
use powdered creamer today.</p>
<p>Remember a few days ago when I said I was going to limit Anki time? I failed to
stop myself again.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2025/01/17/future.webp" alt="393 cards due tomorrow. RIP"></p>
<p>To be fair, probably half of flashcard time today was spent making dim sum
flashcards. I actually had to do some research in Cantonese wikipedia because
some of the <a href="https://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dimsum1.htm">items</a> had weird or
missing translations.</p>

            <p>Finally got unblocked at a task at work. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m done though.</p>
<p>I went to Jherzey&rsquo;s by walking just like the previous days, but didn&rsquo;t know
there was a snows squall. That made the walk pretty interesting. I had to go
back home and actually bundle up to cover my face.</p>
<p>After shovelling, I spent 3 hours with Devin to solve a false LSP error on some
embedded C toolchain. We failed to actually get rid of it, but it was a
character-building experience.</p>

            <p>Been consistently waking up at 9am which is good in a way because I&rsquo;m being
consistent, but bad in a way because it&rsquo;s so late. My alarm clocks are failing
me for some reason.</p>
<p>I had to slowly clear out the 239 cards to review throughout the day, and now I
have 244 cards for tomorrow. It&rsquo;s really going to be a grind this week but I
only have 425 new cards out of 1210.</p>

            <p>Got up at 9am again today. No worries though, since the rest of my day wasn&rsquo;t
wasted.</p>
<p>I finally followed my scheduled tasks, limiting my Anki review to only 1 hour
today. That meant fewer new cards today, but at least I didn&rsquo;t waste any more
time with it and lightened up my review load to only 239 cards for tomorrow.</p>
<p>I also got the chance to get some physical activity:</p>

            <p>Productive day at work despite waking up at 9am.</p>
<p>I think I have really overdone the flashcards now.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2025/01/13/running.webp" alt="Running total of 554 cards to review in 6 days."></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have the vocabulary that actually matters, which are dim sum items.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2025/01/13/counts.webp" alt="581 new cards to go"></p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;m making good progress on the new cards. I could probably be
exposed to the entire deck by the end of the month. I&rsquo;m just hoping I retain
them until March.</p>

            <p>Gonna have to combine these two because I forgot what I did already aside from
the times I went out 😭.</p>
<p>I slept for half the day for both days and just planned our trip.</p>
<p>Saturday: Unlimited K-BBQ at Ginseng with Jherzey and Ate Mup. I could&rsquo;ve eaten
a lot more but tried to hold back.</p>
<p>Sunday: Jerusalem Shawarma and Krispy Kreme with
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yahya-al-shamali_capstoneproject-riscv-fpga-ugcPost-7185133097288437760-Zjjd">Yahya and Kyle</a>.</p>

            <p>Being a Tagalog speaker and a language learner, I&rsquo;ve always been interested in
etymology of Tagalog words. The obvious influences are Spanish and English, but
there&rsquo;s also a lot from Hokkien and Malay.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m going to list out some words that I find interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Linggo</em> (Sunday; week) - All the days in Tagalog are directly borrowed from
Spanish one to one, except for Sunday (<em>domingo</em>). Apparently it could be from
Malay <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/minggu#Malay"><em>minggu</em></a> which came from
Portuguese <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/domingo#Portuguese"><em>domingo</em></a>. Of
course, both of those could be traced to Latin, and Portuguese and Spanish are
pretty close to each other. I just find it interesting that we get to the same
word in a pretty roundabout way.</p>

            <p>I actually got up at 6 and felt a lot more motivated today. The fact that I was
probably around only 70% productivity the day before meant that I had to go ham
today. I finally got around starting my daily/weekly planner (and actually
following it).</p>
<p>Also the fact that I also got approved for my PH vacation gave me a lot more
motivation.</p>
<p>Walked to Jherzey&rsquo;s place while it was raining and super slippery outside. I
actually slipped and landed on my butt.</p>

            <p>This was the day that I got up at 6 but stayed in bed until 9 😭 so much for
waking up early.</p>
<p>I ate a small clove of garlic in the morning and it was pretty spicy. Tried
eating a bigger one and it gave me a crazy heartburn.</p>
<p>Had a CitySync discussion with Michael before he leaves for Vietnam.</p>
<p>I also tried out Reaper but didn&rsquo;t get too far. This was mostly why I didn&rsquo;t get
to journal for this day, but I also had to deal with a super annoying bug at
work way past work hours.</p>

hit different.</p>
<p>Also super locked in at work.</p>
<p>Had K-BBQ at home for dinner with pork belly and organ meats.</p>
<p>I asked Jherzey to help me skin the cat and it definitely scared her. I did more
after she left but my right shoulder started hurting. I&rsquo;m gonna have to take it

Answer: A static website consists of fixed content that remains the same for
all users and is created using HTML/CSS, while a dynamic website uses
server-side technologies to generate content dynamically, allowing for

users."></p>

            <p>Feeling good today. I got to fix the collision bug that was happening yesterday. It actually had to do with the
collision lifecycle, so to make the player detectable, I decoupled the check from the lifecycle of the bomb. Because of
this, I could revert the player&rsquo;s bomb timer to normal. Moving away from a project and letting your brain sit on a
problem for a while really does wonders.</p>

            <p>MAJOR BUG ALERT!!</p>
<p>Apparently my collision logic for the bombs weren&rsquo;t going to hold up. Every time a bomb explodes, there is a small time
window where you can place a bomb and the bomb would not recognize the player, making it a &ldquo;not new&rdquo; bomb. Because of
that, the player gets pushed off right away and could end up in the weirdest of places.</p>
<p>After hours of debugging I couldn&rsquo;t really solve it because of how the collision library orders the entity updates. I
didn&rsquo;t feel like giving up for today, though, and making no progress. I simply created a deployment script to deploy the
game to <a href="https://cbebe.github.io/boboman/">GitHub pages</a> and fixed the player update logic so it at least doesn&rsquo;t end up
outside of the map. Still a pretty good day even if I didn&rsquo;t make as much progress as I wanted.</p>
