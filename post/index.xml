      <description>I got too deep into refactoring and worked past 9 PM üò≠&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s Friday tomorrow anyway, so maybe I could get off early once I&amp;rsquo;ve done all of the important tasks.&#xA;Today is Jherzey and Jesse&amp;rsquo;s last day in Cancun so I&amp;rsquo;m going to accompany Jherzey&amp;rsquo;s dad to the airport to pick them up. Might grab some food after that.</description>

      <description>Well, that was short-lived. My last post was 17 days ago. Maybe the fact that I made an actual blog post made this too high-effort. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for Jherzey reminding me about my website, I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have started again. Here we go&amp;hellip;&#xA;The past 2 weeks was consumed by tons of distractions, with no opportunity to get bored. I binge-watched Over Run Over on YouTube, and once that was done, binge-watched Trauma Code on Netflix.</description>

      <description>Been sleeping too much on weekends recently. I planned on going out to downtown on Saturday but woke up at 4:30 pm. I just did flashcards, watched some YouTube, and went back to sleep for 12 hours again.&#xA;Today I did go out tubing and eat out with the Gen Z gang.&#xA;This weekend was mostly just watching the interactions between American and Chinese people on Â∞èÁ∫¢‰π¶ (Rednote).</description>

      <description>Finally got unblocked at a task at work. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m done though.&#xA;I went to Jherzey&amp;rsquo;s by walking just like the previous days, but didn&amp;rsquo;t know there was a snows squall. That made the walk pretty interesting. I had to go back home and actually bundle up to cover my face.&#xA;After shovelling, I spent 3 hours with Devin to solve a false LSP error on some embedded C toolchain.</description>

      <description>Been consistently waking up at 9am which is good in a way because I&amp;rsquo;m being consistent, but bad in a way because it&amp;rsquo;s so late. My alarm clocks are failing me for some reason.&#xA;I had to slowly clear out the 239 cards to review throughout the day, and now I have 244 cards for tomorrow. It&amp;rsquo;s really going to be a grind this week but I only have 425 new cards out of 1210.</description>

      <description>Got up at 9am again today. No worries though, since the rest of my day wasn&amp;rsquo;t wasted.&#xA;I finally followed my scheduled tasks, limiting my Anki review to only 1 hour today. That meant fewer new cards today, but at least I didn&amp;rsquo;t waste any more time with it and lightened up my review load to only 239 cards for tomorrow.&#xA;I also got the chance to get some physical activity:</description>

      <description>Gonna have to combine these two because I forgot what I did already aside from the times I went out üò≠.&#xA;I slept for half the day for both days and just planned our trip.&#xA;Saturday: Unlimited K-BBQ at Ginseng with Jherzey and Ate Mup. I could&amp;rsquo;ve eaten a lot more but tried to hold back.&#xA;Sunday: Jerusalem Shawarma and Krispy Kreme with Yahya and Kyle.&#xA;Lots of cramming on flashcards as well, but not as much as today (Monday).</description>

      <description>Being a Tagalog speaker and a language learner, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in etymology of Tagalog words. The obvious influences are Spanish and English, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a lot from Hokkien and Malay.&#xA;Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to list out some words that I find interesting:&#xA;Linggo (Sunday; week) - All the days in Tagalog are directly borrowed from Spanish one to one, except for Sunday (domingo). Apparently it could be from Malay minggu which came from Portuguese domingo.</description>

      <description>I actually got up at 6 and felt a lot more motivated today. The fact that I was probably around only 70% productivity the day before meant that I had to go ham today. I finally got around starting my daily/weekly planner (and actually following it).&#xA;Also the fact that I also got approved for my PH vacation gave me a lot more motivation.&#xA;Walked to Jherzey&amp;rsquo;s place while it was raining and super slippery outside.</description>

      <description>This was the day that I got up at 6 but stayed in bed until 9 üò≠ so much for waking up early.&#xA;I ate a small clove of garlic in the morning and it was pretty spicy. Tried eating a bigger one and it gave me a crazy heartburn.&#xA;Had a CitySync discussion with Michael before he leaves for Vietnam.&#xA;I also tried out Reaper but didn&amp;rsquo;t get too far.</description>

      <description>Woke up early today and did cardio. Almost puked but the cold shower afterwards hit different.&#xA;Also super locked in at work.&#xA;Had K-BBQ at home for dinner with pork belly and organ meats.&#xA;I asked Jherzey to help me skin the cat and it definitely scared her. I did more after she left but my right shoulder started hurting. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to take it easy on the shoulder exercises.</description>

      <description>Pretty productive day!&#xA;Found a beat for focusing at work so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit in silence anymore.&#xA;I also tried out some online shopping haul with Jherzey after work before eating momos.&#xA;Just now, I set up Anki with Cantonese flashcards. I picked one without Chinese characters so I actually have to associate sounds to meaning.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been consistently waking up at 7 which means that I can finally get to sleep early (which is why I&amp;rsquo;m actually able to write before midnight now).</description>

      <description>Finally found some appropriate background music for when I&amp;rsquo;m working.&#xA;My peers used to always ask me what I listen to while working on my computer, and they&amp;rsquo;re always shocked to find out that I work in silence. I used to unironically listen to lofi hip hop mix üìö beats to relax/study to but I get too sleepy. When I listen to music I actually like listening to, I get too distracted.</description>

      <description>Slept pretty much until the afternoon and then worked on CitySync stuff.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s already Sunday so I basically skipped 2 days of journalling. I definitely need to streamline this process. I could try using Obsidian for easier journalling and then automate the publishing process.</description>

      <description>I got my passport today so I am now legally allowed to leave the country üòå&#xA;I think I should start scheduling my off-work hours because I&amp;rsquo;m bad at time management and get distracted easily. It&amp;rsquo;s already past midnight that I&amp;rsquo;m writing on the journal.&#xA;EDIT:&#xA;I forgot to add why I wanted to do this in the first place. I found an old notebook of mine from 5+ years ago that had this entry:</description>

      <description>Fall 2023 was my first semester coming back after being out of school for 16 months (I tried taking CHINA 101 in Fall 2022 but dropped it after a week).&#xA;Because of that, I have forgotten how to study. Both midterms and finals went pretty horribly. It&amp;rsquo;s not even that I don&amp;rsquo;t care about grades anymore, and I definitely could have done better if I just did the practice exams thoughtfully.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago, I help a friend set up a website for a business. Today, I had another talk with a friend about building a portfolio website and he asked me for a few resources. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a comprehensive one that outlines all the required steps so I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best.&#xA;What is a static website? From ChatGPT:&#xA;Basically:&#xA;Static - no server-side logic, cheaper Dynamic - with server-side logic, more expensive What makes a (static) website Setting up a static website is basically free these days, maybe a few dollars a year if you want a custom domain.</description>

      <description>I deleted all 4 of my NPM packages today. It has been over a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve last updated them, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to add any more clutter to the system.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that having published open source code meant something, but then I realized that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it&amp;rsquo;s not useful.&#xA;Learning how to package libraries and applications was a good experience, though, and I would probably publish stuff IF/WHEN I have actually solved a need.</description>

      <description>A new co-op position meant new hardware1, and a new technology stack to learn. Unfortunately, that includes having to use Windows. Coming back to Windows after almost 2 full years on Linux, it felt like I forgot how to use a computer. All the keyboard shortcuts that my hands were used to would do funny things like lock my laptop. I just wanted my shell, my terminal, and my tiling window manager back.</description>

      <description>I feel like the hardest part of writing this game would be the enemy logic. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m putting it off for as long as possible! Today I implemented map generation, randomly placing boxes sufficiently far enough from players.&#xA;I also added controls for other players, which reminded me of my local multiplayer experience with Boxhead. I miss having multiple people on play a single keyboard. These days it would be awkward to play that way.</description>

      <description>Feeling good today. I got to fix the collision bug that was happening yesterday. It actually had to do with the collision lifecycle, so to make the player detectable, I decoupled the check from the lifecycle of the bomb. Because of this, I could revert the player&amp;rsquo;s bomb timer to normal. Moving away from a project and letting your brain sit on a problem for a while really does wonders.</description>

      <description>MAJOR BUG ALERT!!&#xA;Apparently my collision logic for the bombs weren&amp;rsquo;t going to hold up. Every time a bomb explodes, there is a small time window where you can place a bomb and the bomb would not recognize the player, making it a &amp;ldquo;not new&amp;rdquo; bomb. Because of that, the player gets pushed off right away and could end up in the weirdest of places.&#xA;After hours of debugging I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really solve it because of how the collision library orders the entity updates.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been heavily configuring my text editor, Neovim, which means that I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of Lua. I do&#xA;find it enjoyable, even without having any tooling initially, so I wanted to give game development and&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://love2d.org&#34;&gt;Love2D&lt;/a&gt; a try. I just finished&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents&#34;&gt;Sheepolution&amp;rsquo;s How to L√ñVE&lt;/a&gt; book on Love2D, and felt prepared to make&#xA;my first game from scratch. As per Jherzey&amp;rsquo;s request, I&amp;rsquo;m creating a Bomberman clone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TIL: My actual height</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned what my actual height was (at least at the time of writing). For a few years now I&amp;rsquo;ve always kind of&#xA;just stuck with 170 cm because that&amp;rsquo;s what was in my driver&amp;rsquo;s license when I got it 5 years ago (I really need to pass&#xA;the road test this year). I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if that was right at the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
